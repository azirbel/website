# Changelog

One of the best parts of looking back at old work is seeing how your
sense of design has progressed over the years. I think as long as
you're able to laugh at your old work, you're making progress.

### Version 1.0.0 _(December 8, 2009)_

* Decide grunge is the ideal style for a homepage.
* Add grungy background image which tiles to fill the screen.
* Infatuation with dark red begins. Other colors dismissed.
* Fonts dismissed as unnecessary.
  * Low contrast with background determined fashionable.
* Discover favicon.ico. Add meaningless blob of color.
* Discover the magic of hover images
  * Hover images take too long to load. Investigate preloading.
  * Find snippets of javascript on the web; use blindly.

### Version 1.0.0 _(June 27, 2010)_

* Remove grunge. Replace with overpowering beige.
* Add sepia portrait to complement the beige.
* Add dark red robot to complement nothing.
  * Make sure the robot sticks out by putting it in the bottom right
    where it clearly does not belong
* Add real projects page, using carefully styled images
* Add fantastic sun-themed header.
  * Trivia: the beige theme, and sun icon, is all copied from the hat
    I am wearing in the picture, which is my new favorite hat ever.
