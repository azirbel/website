This is my first "real" blog post!

At the risk of being boring right out of the gate, I thought I'd use
this post to explain why I'm starting a blog.

## On blogs

The first reason I'm starting a blog is because I love blogs and wish that more
of them existed.

In fact, I wish all my friends had blogs.

Actually, they don't have to be _blogs_. What I like about blogs, and want
more of, is the mindset they encourage:

* Original content instead of "sharing"
* Longer writing instead of tweet-sized tidbits
* Writing with your own voice instead of being a cautious robot

Unfortunately, blogs also have the side-effect of being public to world.
So you can't put anything really personal on them, and you have to be
careful all the time because you can't just take things _off_ the
internet.

I'm not sure why "public" is still the only decent option for blogs. If it
was easy to start a blog, but restrict it so only your Facebook friends
could see it, I bet there would be a lot more blogs. Ghost, my favorite
blogging platform, has a feature called [private
blogs](https://blog.ghost.org/private-blogs/), but that's not quite enough
- if someone shares or leaks the password you picked, how would you know?

Social-media-authenticated blogs would be great. Just saying.

I've already tried to start a blog several times, and never got off the
ground because I'm very self-conscious about writing publicly. So this
will be a struggle, but hopefully I'll get better at it over time.

I think blogs go wrong in two ways, mostly:

1. **Arrogance** - when the author starts preaching instead of writing
   like they were a normal person. Usually happens when the author takes
   "this worked for me" and turns it into "Having trouble over there? Try
   doing _this_!"

2. **Lack of research** - when the author makes a recommendation, but
   doesn't know what they're talking about. This is especially frustrating
   for technical blogs. If you're comparing X to Y, and you only have
   experience in X, you'd better _at least_ mention that, right?

So I'll just avoid those two problems, and I should be fine?

## On writing

The second reason I'm starting a blog is to become a better writer.

Despite being at least fifty years old, writing is up there with
infographics and animated cartoons when it comes to spreading ideas. In
fact, it might even be better. I'd like to have ideas worth spreading
someday, and animating cartoons takes too long, so it's time to start
practicing my writing.

How to write better?

My two favorite essayists have put together some great advice:

* Paul Graham's [Write Like You Talk](http://paulgraham.com/talk.html)
  recommends writing in simple, informal language.

* Scott Alexander's [Nonfiction Writing
  Advice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/) is
  a little more in-depth, and great for persuasive writing. It's more
  useful than the stuff I learned in school, because (1) Scott Alexander
  is brilliant, and (2) some advice, like how to defend yourself from
  ad-hominem "counter-arguments", is especially important when you're
  writing in a world containing angry twitter mobs.

After seeing the [backlash](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10826838)
that Paul Graham got from his essay on economic inequality, I think even
he could learn something from Scott Alexander. I liked PG's argument, but
he didn't try nearly hard enough to anticipate and defuse
counterarguments.

The last bit of writing advice I plan to follow is Patrick McKenzie's
[Making Your Writing Work Harder For
You](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/content-marketing-strategy).
Most importantly: good writing should last.

He recommends calling your writing "articles" or "essays", and not "blog
posts", because (in his words), "blog posts are quickly-depreciating
commoditized drek."

I decided to ignore that advice and call this a blog anyway, but I get it.
I'll avoid real-time commentary on events, and instead focus on writing
longer-lasting, thoughtful stuff.

In fact, I even plan to edit my old posts liberally when they go out of
date, or if I decide that they're embarrassing. Hopefully this strategy
will also make me less self-conscious about posting in the first place.

Since editing posts after the fact is (debatably) uncool, I'll make up for
it by keeping all the published revisions of my essays in my website's
[git history](https://github.com/azirbel/website).

## Topics for this blog

This is a technical, or at least semi-technical, blog. I'll write about
anything I find interesting in the world of software and startups.

For example, I'd like to write about:

* Projects I'm working on
* Projects I'd like to work on, but probably won't get to
* Books I read, and what I thought of them
* Companies or software products I like
* Things I've learned about engineering or design

I'll probably start by writing a series about
[vim](http://www.vim.org/weird.php). It might only be interesting to a few
people, but that's ok.

## Wrapping up
