I recently had to add password-reset emails to my project
[npoint.io](https://www.npoint.io). In case you haven't heard, creating HTML
emails is a huge mess.

Here's my research on the best/quickest way to set up emails for a side project
or as a solo developer.

(TL;DR: I went with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/))

## Sending emails in two steps

There are two challenges in setting up an automated email:

1. Creating an email template
2. Sending the email

Since I was using Rails, my default option was using Rails mailers. I could
create a template using a high-level language ([MJML](https://mjml.io/) or
[ZURB Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)) or a service like [Bee
Free](https://beefree.io/) that spits out HTML. There's also
[Litmus](https://litmus.com/) for cross-platform testing, though that was out
of my budget as an indie developer.

For step 2 (sending), some good tools are [Sparkpost](https://www.sparkpost.com/),
[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), and [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).
They mainly compete on ease-of-use, pricing, and delivery rates (avoiding user
spam filters).

I was ready to go with ZURB Foundation (templates) + Sparkpost (delivery),
until I realized there was an easier way.

## Sending emails in one step

There are services that combine (1) and (2). You create a template using their
template builder, then send them an API request to actually send an email.

This is faster to set up, and doesn't require a deploy to change what an email
looks like. Ideally, the template editor should also take care of
cross-platform issues without you even thinking about it.

I think [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) is the best option for a small
project. They have a WYSIWYG template editor which is (barely) good enough
for simple emails, and their free tier goes up to 10,000 emails a day.

Honorable mentions:
[Sparkpost](https://www.sparkpost.com/features/email-templates/) and
[Posteage](http://postageapp.com/) (no WYSIWYG editing);
[Iterable](https://iterable.com/) (also handles "when to send" logic, but UI is
frustrating at best).

Setting up my template in SendGrid was a solid 4/5 star experience:

And my app code looks roughly like this: ([real
code here](https://github.com/azirbel/npoint/blob/master/app/lib/transactional_mail.rb))

```ruby
def self.reset_password(user)
  mail = SendGrid::Mail.new
  mail.from = SendGrid::Email.new(
    email: 'n:point <support@npoint.io>'
  )

  personalization = SendGrid::Personalization.new
  personalization.add_to(
    SendGrid::Email.new(email: user.email)
  )
  personalization.add_substitution(
    SendGrid::Substitution.new(
      key: '%name%',
      value: user.name
    )
  )

  mail.add_personalization(personalization)
  mail.template_id = 'bdf0a64b-087d-4c5f-a955'

  sg = SendGrid::API.new(api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_API_KEY'])
  response = sg.client.mail._('send')
    .post(request_body: mail.to_json)
end
```

## Manual emails

I don't like getting emails from `no-reply@lousy-service.com`. I like getting
emails from `support@great-service.com`, which I can reply to directly.

Setting that up was pretty easy:

#### Inbound emails (Using Namecheap)

1. [Namecheap guide](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/308/77/how-to-setup-email-forwarding)
2. Add a simple alias (forward `support@` to my personal gmail)
3. Add a catch-all (forward everything else to my personal gmail, too)

A caveat that bit me for a while: Namecheap might not forward inbound emails if
they're from the same email account as they're being forwarded to. At least I
was able to use my old hotmail account for something other than receiving spam.

#### Outbound manual emails (Using Gmail)

1. Add a send-from address in Gmail settings
2. Uncheck "treat as alias"
3. Add `smtp.sendgrid.net`
4. Your username is your [sendgrid
   username](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Account_Administration/help_i_cant_find_my_smtp_username_and_password.html);
   your password is your SendGrid API key.

## Results

Emails look passable:

Bonus: SendGrid is totally happy to send emails in dev mode too. I found this
to be a feature because it was really easy to test my reset-password flow
locally.
