My company hires an artist to draw caricatures of all our employees. We
take these and put them on our
[about](https://www.opendoor.com/about) page. It looks like this:

<img src="/static/img/meet-the-team.png" />

When I joined in August 2015, the same artist drew a picture of me:

<img class="small center" src="/static/img/alex-emoji1.png" />

I didn't really like it, so I asked for another one. Version 2 looked like
this:

<img class="small center" src="/static/img/alex-emoji2.png" />

I didn't really like version 2 either, but I had to admit that the problem was
probably me. Since I didn't want to ask for a third version, I just skipped the
onboarding step where I was supposed to add my picture to the website.

[Visnu](https://github.com/visnup) was my onboarding buddy. He nagged me
for a while to add myself to the website, but I never did. Eventually he
stopped nagging.

## April 29, 2016

Every Friday we have a company all-hands meeting where we demo our recent work.

At this point I had been at Opendoor for eight months, so I had almost
forgotten that I wasn't on the website. But apparently Visnu hadn't forgotten,
and he quietly added me that week:

<img class="padded shadow" src="/static/img/add-to-about-us.png" />

He triumphantly presented to the company that I was now on the website despite
my best attempts to hide. There was great applause; everyone laughed. I didn't
laugh. I was furious.

Ok, I laughed.

Visnu even wrote a test to make sure I couldn't sneak off the website again.
He's thorough like that.

<img class="padded shadow" src="/static/img/employee-spec.png" />

I interpreted the test as a challenge to sneak off the website again.

## May 5, 2016

All our code goes through review. To make a change, you submit your code on
Github, and another engineer reads through it. If they don't have any concerns,
they add an `lgtm` ("looks good to me") label.

So to sneak off the website, I would have to change the code in a way that
would be subtle enough to pass code review. Bonus points if the reviewer was
Visnu.

The plan:

**Step 1**: Change enough code that no sane person would read it all carefully.

> 10 lines of code = 10 issues.<br/>500 lines of code = "looks fine."

I found a CSS file that was 422 lines long, and could be broken up into
multiple files. I broke it up. (That was actually a change I'd been wanting to
make anyway.)

**Step 2**: Find a way to hide.

The HTML for our "about" page looks like this:

```html
<li class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">
  <img
    class="img-circle"
    src="/path/to/assets/about_us/emoji/alexz.png"/>
  <div class="prose">
    <h4>Alex Zirbel</h4>
    <h5>Engineering</h5>
    <p>
      Alex joins us from Addepar, where he worked
      as a frontend engineer. Before that, he
      studied robotics at Carnegie Mellon.
    </p>
  </div>
</li>
```

I wrote some CSS so that whenever an image has "alexz" in its filename, it will
be invisible.

```css
img[src*=alexz], img[src*=alexz] + div {
  display: none;
}
```

**Step 3**: Hide the new code.

1. Instead of checking for "alexz" in an image's filename, just check for
   "exz".  That does the same thing, but it's less obvious.
2. "exz" looks a little like "exclude", so add a fake `.button-exclude` style
   to make things look more legitimate.

```css
input[type=submit], input[type=reset], button, .button {
  // 78 lines of code
}

.button-exclude, img[src*=exz], img[src*=exz] + div {
  display: none;
}

.button-group {
  // Lots more code
}
```

**Step 4**: (Important!) Wait until at least 10pm.

Most people don't work at 10pm, but Visnu will often appear if you tag him
asking for a review.

**Step 5**: Request code review.

<img class="padded shadow" src="/static/img/break-up-inputs-css.png" />

**Step 6**: Success!

<img class="center medium" src="/static/img/visnu-lgtm.png" />

## Results

If you looked at the website in the next few days, you would have seen
something like this:

<img src="/static/img/blank-space.png" />

## May 16, 2016

After about a week, I started feeling guilty. The "about" page looked broken
because of the blank space where I was supposed to be; one of my co-workers
even filed a bug report about it.

Luckily for my guilt, Visnu figured it out pretty soon. In typical Visnu style,
he didn't just fix the website -- first he wrote a bot to monitor the page and
make sure I was there. If I wasn't, the bot would sound the alarm.

<img class="center medium" src="/static/img/missing-zirbel-bot.png" />

_Then_ he fixed the website.

<img class="padded shadow" src="/static/img/zirbel-check-fix.png" />

Total days in hiding: `11`<br/>Total days on website: `7` (and counting)
