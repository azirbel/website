This is my first "serious" blog post!

## Structure

* Why make a blog?
  * I wish more of my friends had blogs!
  * I like the blogs that my friends do have.
* What kind of blog will this be?
  * Technical
  * Hopefully, lots of content will be timeless
  * I am self conscious so I may edit and delete posts
    * However, edits will be kept in version control in case you really want to dig
* Goals from this blog
  * Learning
* Write in conversational style
* Things I plan to write about
  * Vim
  * Projects I work on
  * Jobs
  * Commentary on events and new things in the world of engineering
  * Book reviews and recommendations
* Using Hugo
  * It's awesome so far!
  * I am going to make my blog layout into a hugo theme.
* Blog design (this should mostly be in a separate post)
  * Single type of page for posts, projects, etc
  * All navigation in the sidebar
  * Footnotes on the side
