A couple years went by since escape #2. I guess I must have actually been
working.

Meanwhile, Opendoor was growing like bananas. In early 2018 we had over 400
employees in 6+ markets. That's a couple too many employees to fit on one about
page! So we replaced it with a shorter description of the founders and
executive team:

(JD and Ian are cut off, find them at
[opendoor.com/about](https://www.opendoor.com/about))

Now that everyone was off the page, naturally I had to be on it.

I decided to cheat this time and skip code review. What this situation called
for was an A/B test!

Optimizely makes it easy to inject HTML into pages.

With a thrilling name like "About Page Copy", I was pretty sure nobody would
bother to investigate.

I think everyone deserves the enhanced experience.

## Results

Our about page looked like this for a week:
