Mini project!

[Touch Bar Timer](https://touch-bar-timer.alexzirbel.com) is a little stopwatch
for your Mac's touch bar.

I made it to track how I spend my time over the course of the day. I really
only care about one metric: time spent on my #1 priority project.

There are other good timer apps, like
[Thyme](https://joaomoreno.github.io/thyme/), but tapping the touch bar is just
that little bit faster. And you can see it in fullscreen.

It's free, get it here:

*(I had a lot of fun with the landing page and put an easter egg in. You'll
know when you've found it.)*

## How it works

Apple's touch bar isn't really meant to be configured, but you can add exactly
one extra button to the four permanent buttons on the right. Touch Bar Timer
uses this spot.

* **Tap** to start/stop.
* **Double-tap** to reset.
* **Hold** to open the app preferences.

The timer automatically logs your data to a CSV file, which you can
configure in the app preferences.

The CSV comes out looking like this:

<div class='data-table'></div>

start | end | duration | total_duration
--- | --- | --- | ---
2018-04-26<br/>17:26:48 | 2018-04-26<br/>17:26:51 | 2.444552 | 4.876597
2018-04-26<br/>17:26:55 | 2018-04-26<br/>17:26:59 | 3.362658 | 8.239082

This makes it easy for you to run your own analytics in Excel.

## Thanks to Pixel Point!

I started with the code from [Pixel Point](https://pixelpoint.io/)'s [Mute
Me](https://github.com/pixel-point/mute-me) app.

Here's their writeup:

Hopefully, Touch Bar Timer is your second useful Touch Bar app.
