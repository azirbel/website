This is my first "real" blog post!

At the risk of being boring right out of the gate, I thought I'd use
this first post to explain why I'm starting a blog.

## On blogs

The first reason I'm starting a blog is because I love blogs and wish that more
of them existed.

What I like most about blogs:

* They're personal, and the author keeps his or her own voice.
* They're a conversation starter. Even when the author is wrong, or did poor
  research, commenters can add something the author missed.
* They work like the internet's supposed to work (or at least, how I want the
  internet to work). The author has complete control over the site.
  Links work like they were intended to, leading you to a rabbit hole of
  interesting essays and related blogs if you want to keep reading.
* Posts are short and sweet (or should be), but they still stand on their own.

In fact, I wish all my friends blogged. The longer, essay format is a nice
change from facebook and twitter. I like every single blog that my friends _do_
have.

One of my friends is a blog-hater, mostly because blog authors tend to write
about topics they haven't bothered to research. Which is fair. I've seen a ton
of posts with the format: "are you trying to decide between X, Y and Z? Well, I
tried X and it worked for me. I heartily recommend it over the other choices."
This makes an amateur sound like an expert in X, Y, and Z, even though they
obviously aren't. The fans of X will spread it like wildfire through social
media, and it'll show up as a top hit for "X vs Y" on google, and so on.

Which is to say, blogs are pretty much as unreliable as every other type of media.
[Paul Graham's essay on news and PR](http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html)
was an eye-opener for me.

But in their defense, blogs are at least assumed to be "just some person's
opinion", so it's a step up from the rest of the press.

I agree that bloggers should be more careful to write about topics they
actually know something about, should be more responsible researchers, and
should be less pretentious. I'll try to do that in my blog.

## Writing style

The second reason I'm starting a blog is to learn how to write better.

Writing is still the best way to spread ideas. It's faster to skim than a
video; parts of an argument can be quoted and discussed; and an
essay can be shared and discussed as a persuasive unit.

So, how to write better?

My two favorite essayists have put together some great advice. Paul Graham's
[Write Like You Talk](http://paulgraham.com/talk.html) recommends writing
in a conversational style. Taking the same ideas farther, Scott Alexander's [Nonfiction Writing
Advice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/) is great
for persuasive writing. It's more useful than the stuff I learned in school,
because (1) Scott Alexander is brilliant and (2) some advice, like
defending yourself from ad-hominem "counter-arguments", is especially important
for writing in the world of angry twitter mobs.

I think that even Paul Graham could learn something from that essay,
given the huge backlash to his essay on Economic Inequality. He made a
great argument, but he didn't make it digestable for hostile
readers who were approaching the topic from another direction.

The last bit of writing advice I plan to follow is Patrick McKenzie's
[Making Your Writing Work Harder For You](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/content-marketing-strategy).
Most importantly: good writing should last.

He suggests referring to your writing as "articles" or "essays", because a
"blog" doesn't imply that the writing will last. Or in his words, "Blog posts
are quickly-depreciating commoditized drek".

I've decided to call this a blog anyway, but I'll try to avoid real-time
commentary on events, and instead focus on longer-lasting helpful stuff.
Essays.

In fact, I even plan to edit my old posts liberally when they go out of date,
or if I decide that they're embarrassing. Hopefully, this strategy will make me
less self-conscious (something I struggle with a lot).

Since editing posts after the fact is sometimes uncool, I'll make up for it
by keeping all the old versions of stuff in my website's
[git history](https://github.com/azirbel/website).

## Topics for this blog

The topic shall be: anything I find interesting in the world of software and
startups.

For example, I'd like to write about:

* Projects I'm working on
* Projects I'd like to work on, but probably won't work on
* Books I read, and what I thought of them
* Companies or software products I like
* Technical advice for UI design and engineering

I'll probably start by writing a series about [vim](TODO: link). It might only
be interesting to a few people, but it's something I've researched well and
have strong opinions about.

## Wrapping up

I love feedback!

I'm trying to prepare myself mentally, but I think I'll still find it hard to
write to an audience of just-over-zero people.

If you liked, or didn't like, or had any thoughts whatsoever about something I
wrote - I'd love to hear it. Even if it's a chat message or one-line email. My
email address is [alexzirbel@gmail.com](mailto:alexzirbel@gmail.com). If you
liked what I wrote, then I'm also on twitter as
[@alexzirbel](https://twitter.com/alexzirbel).
