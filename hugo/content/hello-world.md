This is my first "real" blog post!

At the risk of being boring right out of the gate, I thought I'd use this first
post to explain what I hope to accomplish here.

I love blogs:

* They're personal, and the author has a distinct voice.
* They're open and work like the internet's supposed to work. The author has
  complete control over what's there. Links work; taking a "snapshot" of the
  page works.
* They can start a conversation. Even when the author is wrong, or did poor
  research, commenters can add something the author missed.
* Posts are short and sweet (or should be), and yet stand on their own.

In fact, I wish all my friends blogged. I like the format, and I bet they'd
have interesting things to say.

One of my friends hates blogs, mostly because blog authors tend to write about
topics they haven't researched whatsoever. I've seen a ton of posts of the
format: "trying to decide between X, Y and Z? I tried X and it worked great for
me. I heartily recommend it over the other choices". When it's written well,
this makes an amateur come off as a real expert in X, Y, and Z. And the fans of
X will spread it like wildfire through social media, and it'll show up as a top
hit for "X vs Y" on google, and so on.

Which is to say, blogs are pretty much the same as
[every other type of media](http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html).

I agree that more bloggers should be careful to write about topics they
actually know something about, should be more responsible researchers, and
should be less pretentious. I'll try to do that in my blog.

But at least, blogs are assumed to be "just some person's opinion", so it's a
step up from the rest of the press.

## Writing Style

The second reason I'm starting a blog is to learn how to write better.

Writing is still the best way to spread ideas. It's faster to skim than a
video; parts of an argument can be quoted and discussed; and an
essay can be shared and discussed as a persuasive unit.

So, how to learn to write better?

My two favorite essayists have put together some great advice. Paul Graham's
essay [Write Like You Talk](http://paulgraham.com/talk.html) recommends writing
in a conversational style. From there, Scott Alexander's [Nonfiction Writing
Advice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/) is a great
summary of persuasive writing. It's more useful than the standard high-school
stuff because (1) Scott Alexander is brilliant and (2) some advice, like
defending yourself from ad-hominem "counterarguments", is especially important
for writing in the world of angry twitter mobs.

In fact, I think Paul Graham could learn something from that essay himself,
given the huge backlash to his essay on Economic Inequality. I think he made a
great argument, but he didn't try very hard to make it digestable for hostile
readers who were approaching the topic from another direction.

The last bit of writing advice I'll try to follow is Patrick McKenzie's
[Making Your Writing Work Harder For You](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/content-marketing-strategy).
The most import recommendation here is that writing should last. Or in his
words, "Blog posts are quickly-depreciating commoditized drek".

I've decided to call this a blog anyway, but I'll try to avoid real-time
responses to drama, and instead focus on longer-lasting helpful stuff.

In fact, I even plan to edit my old posts liberally when they go out of date,
or I decide that they're now embarrassing. Hopefully, as a bonus it will make
me less self-conscious, which is something I struggle with a lot.

Since editing posts after the fact is sometimes not-cool, I'll make up for it
by keeping all my old versions of posts in my website's [git
history](https://github.com/azirbel/website).

## So, what's the blog about, then?

Anything I find interesting in the world of software and startups.

I'd like to write about:

* Projects I'm working on
* Ideas for projects I'd like to work on, but probably won't
* Books I read and what I thought of them
* Technical advice for the UI design and engineering world

I'll probably start by writing a series about vim. It might only be interesting
to a few people, but it's something I've researched well and have some strong
opinions about.

## Wrapping up

I love feedback!

I'm trying to prepare myself for it mentally, but I think I'll still find it
hard to write to an audience of just-over-zero people.

If you liked, or didn't like, or had any thoughts whatsoever, on something I
wrote - I'd love to hear it. Even if it's a one-line email. My email address is
[alexzirbel@gmail.com](mailto:alexzirbel@gmail.com). If you liked what I wrote,
I'm also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alexzirbel).
