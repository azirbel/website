This is my new website and blog!

Once I have a few posts or projects, I'll list them here. In the meantime,
here's my only post:

[Hello World]({{< relref "hello-world.md" >}})

I made this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It was a great experience,
and I'd definitely recommend it. The only tough part was that I wanted to use
SASS and other new stuff, which required having a build process. You can see my
setup [on Github](https://github.com/azirbel/website).

Hugo comes with an RSS feed. You can use the RSS icon in the sidebar to get it.
