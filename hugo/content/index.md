This is my new website and blog!

Posts:

* [Hello World]({{< relref "hello-world.md" >}})
* [Goodbye, Likes and Feeds]({{< relref "goodbye-likes-and-feeds.md" >}})
* [Escape the About Page, Part 1]({{< relref "escape-the-about-page-1.md" >}})
* [Escape the About Page, Part 2]({{< relref "escape-the-about-page-2.md" >}})

I made this blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It was a great experience,
and I'd definitely recommend it. The only tough part was that I wanted to use
SASS and other new stuff, which required having a build process. You can see my
setup [on Github](https://github.com/azirbel/website).

Hugo comes with an RSS feed. If you use RSS, and I know you don't, you can
use the RSS icon in the sidebar to subscribe.
